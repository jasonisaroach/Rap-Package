I put it on for the family,
Every day i gotta get it bag
I bring it back to the family
every day I gotta get what I had

I put it on for the family
every day i gotta get it
I put it on for the family
you won't ever catch me slippin

I put it on for the family
Everything I do for the bag
I put it on for the family
me and mines never down bad

You was tweakin and tweaking
I see you take a peek at the peak
I'm ahead of the heat
I'm more a trendsetter
If you stand next to me
coupe de grace my vendetta

and you gonna bleed
you can't step to me
