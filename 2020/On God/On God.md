yuh
aye
okay,okay

on god
i make some money
give it to my mama

on god,
me and my family 
poppin collars

on god,
i swear my team 
ain't causin problems

on god
we don't give a fuck 
about a dolla
<!--sdfsdfsd -->

on god,
i swear I do this shit for the art

i was born a soldier 
but raised to build the ark

on god,
i was born an alien 
among the humans
everybody watchin', waiting,
askin' how I do this

on god
I don't stress

i just stay my lane,
put some pressure on they necks

on god,
gotcha girl whipped

i just signed a deal
now i'm cashing out my check


on god

yeah, on god

on jah

yeah, okay 

on god,
i swear to god i
never thought I'd do this

used to be a school nerd,
but now i'm making music

on god
this shit is kinda weird
but everything i'm saying is so
true and sincere


on god,
oh god, oh my god

i don't why
but my mind beginning to stop

on god,
oh god, oh my god

ain't it crazy how a brain start to rot

my life was normal till she told me gone

i 
stepped through the portal
now i'm talking to a demon spawn
no i don't know 
what i've done

homie took a tab then he told me drop one
i was off in space so i asked him where's the rum
mixed with gin and juice, thought we were having fun
til the show got stopped, and we all had to run

yeah, fuck



i was trippin and tripping
metaphysically and physically
psychologically
i'm slowly,
 losing my mind

i'm so fried, off a tab can't rewind
gotta make through the night
till i see the sunrise


i take the art from my heart
and put it up for display,
i hope that you give it a like,
if I give it a frame

i made this art from my pain,
some might say i'm insane,
the way i'm using my brain

but,
bitch i'll never change
i do this day after day
year after year

motherfucking
season after season

i'm doing this
bitch i'm just tryna please ya
for no reason

like wooby's on the beat
he's 
telling me to do this shit super clean 

like it's
febreeze
and I spit it super mean
I'm so fresh
and so clean
I flow with ease

what this,
and what's that?
i strike with bat,
pull up, what's that
whiplash




riddle me this,
what is a demon without a world
you don't know this
but my other hand can reach around the world

i wear a suit and tie
you wear a dress and bow
you know i'll never die
and i'll never fold

yes I shine
bitch I glow
i'm going global,
whether rain or shine
