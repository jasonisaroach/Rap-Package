We don't talk too much
Don't think that
We should be talking,
We shouldn't be talking

and
I don't want your love
you
leave far too often,
the pain never softens,

why are you so selfish you
play with my emtoions
I shouldn't feels like this
love shouldn't feel like this

I don't think we're right for eachother
go find another
I'll go find another

I don't want to 
be your lover
 we shouldn't ever fight like this

I think you should
find a new lover,
I hope he treats you better than this

Love shouldn't feel like this
Why you gotta do me like this

Oh I'm a sinner
But I thought that 
things would get better
