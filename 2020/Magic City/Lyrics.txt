(high-pitched/girl chanting)
get money, get money, get money, get money

I get some money then I fuckin spend it
i'm living life lavish so I hope I fucking end it






I'm reckless, but anything is possible


if I'm talking to the devil
then I'm overcoming obstacles

hopping over bitches
like they hoppin over leftovers

sneezin and I'm wheezin
like my brother when the seasons change
